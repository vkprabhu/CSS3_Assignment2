		The idea to develop a vehicle with delta wings and angled tail fins is to fly into space, inject an orbiter and land on earth like an aircraft, so it can be reused. This will help cut cost of satellite launches by upto 10 times. An advanced version of the vehicle could also be used for manned missions.
